# Smart-Password-Strength-Checker
This project is a Smart Password Strength Checker built using Python. It analyzes a user-entered password and evaluates its strength based on common security rules used in real-world systems.
### The program checks for:

- Minimum password length
- Presence of uppercase letters
- Presence of lowercase letters
- Presence of numeric digits
- Presence of special characters
  
Based on these checks, the password is scored on a 0–5 scale and categorized as Weak, Medium, or Strong.
For security reasons, the actual password is never displayed or stored—only masked output and metadata are used.

## Technologies & Concepts Used

- Python (core)
- input()
- if / else conditions
- for loops
- len() function
- String methods (isupper(), islower(), isdigit())

File handling (logging results)

Git version control
